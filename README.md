### Ongoing Project: Acoustic Levitation Simulation Using COMSOL Multiphysics
- Achieved **physical proof-of-concept** of acoustic levitation using a mirror and transducer array, successfully levitating a droplet at **6 V input**.  
- Currently developing a **finite-element simulation model** in COMSOL Multiphysics (v6.2) for pressure acoustics in resonator arrays.  
- Implementing **boundary conditions** (e.g., *Normal Acceleration*) and advanced **geometry operations** (partitioning, replace faces, unions) to explore dual array setup and pressure regions.  
- Objective: validate and optimize array design for enhanced stability of droplets.
